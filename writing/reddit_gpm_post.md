Hey everyone,

I've been creating a [music streaming web/mobile app](https://relar.app/?utm_source=gpm_reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=beta_feedback) these past few months as a replacement for Google Play Music which seems to have been officially removed today. The goal of this project was to offer the same hosting/streaming support as GPM for personal audio file collections (there are currently no plans to support purchasing or streaming from preexisting a catalogue). As it stands, I have most of the core features implemented but am still far away from feature parity. Here is an incomplete list of the current features:

- Uploading mp3 files
- Viewing songs and quickly scrolling through your entire collection (no loading while scrolling)
- Editing song metadata
- Viewing albums + artists
- Creating and managing playlists
- Mobile apps for streaming on the go
- "Liking" songs and saving them to a playlist
- Queueing songs/albums/playlists/artists

Features that are in development:

- Smart caching on mobile
- Uploading other file types
- Downloading albums/artists/playlists on mobile
- HEOS support
- Support for at least 20,000 uploaded songs (currently capped at 500)
- Installable desktop player
- Lots of other improvements!

Anyway, I'm launching the beta _today_ to get user feedback and catch bugs before the actual release and would _love_ to get input from the GPM community. The site is now live and you can sign up [here](https://relar.app/signup/?utm_source=gpm_reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=beta_feedback)!!
