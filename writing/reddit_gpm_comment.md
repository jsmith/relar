Hey everyone, I've been creating [a music streaming](https://relar.app/?utm_source=gpm_reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=beta_feedback) web/mobile app these past few months as a replacement for Google Play Music which seems to have been officially removed today. The goal of this project was to offer the same hosting/streaming support as GPM for personal audio file collections. As it stands, I have most of the core features implemented but am still far from feature parity.

Anyway, I'm launching a beta _today_ to get user feedback and catch bugs before the actual release and would _love_ to get feedback from the GPM community. The site is now live and you can sign up [here](https://relar.app/signup/?utm_source=gpm_reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=beta_feedback)!!
