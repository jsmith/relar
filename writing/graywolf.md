Hey all, I've been creating a music streaming web/mobile app these past few months as a replacement for Google Play Music which has been deprecated for awhile and was actually just officially removed today. If you've ever used Google Play Music, you'll probably know that they allow you to upload your personal audio files and them stream these files the web and your phone which is actually sweet for people (ie. me üòÅ) who have curated audio file collections. There is actually a pretty sizable market opportunity since there are really no alternatives with similar features.

Anyway, I'm launching a beta to get user feedback and catch bugs before doing an actual release so if anyone has mp3 files they often listen to, this product might be something you want to try! If you _don't_ have any mp3 files, this product really won't be useful but feel free to check it out since I want to get as much feedback as possible üò¨ You can sign up now at https://relar.app !!
