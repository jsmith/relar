[Relar](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/relar) is a cloud audio file hosting and streaming service with web and mobile apps. With the recent deprecation of Google Play Music (GPM), many individuals are (unsuccessfully) looking for alternatives. Relar aims to fill this market gap by offering the same core features as GPM, and more!

After several months of development, I'm getting ready to launch the MVP and think it's way past due to start getting feedback. The landing page can be found ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://relar.app/?utm_source=indie_hackers&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=landing_feedback) ðŸ‘ˆ and if anyone is interested, the beta signup link is live :)

- Is it clear what features Relar offers?
- Does the landing page have any major UI/UX flaws?
- Are there any improvements you think could be made?

Thanks so much Indie Hackers!!
