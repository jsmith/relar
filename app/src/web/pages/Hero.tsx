    "What file formats do you support?",
    "Only mp3 files are supported at the moment but I plan to add support for other common file formats before the official release.",
  ],
  [
    "Are there any limits to the amount of uploaded songs?",
    "To limit initial costs, each account can only upload 500 songs. The system has been designed to eventually support 20,000 songs per user.",
  ],
  [
    "Are there any limits to the size of each file?",
    "Each song is currently limited to 10MB. Larger files will be supported before the official release.",
  ],
  [
    "Do you actually have iOS and Android apps?",
    "Yes! These apps are still in very early stage development though and lack basic features like offline support.",

  [
    "Is Relar comparable to Google Play Music (GPM)?",
    "Yes and no. GPM was a great service with tens of thousands of engineering hours put into optimizations and improvements whereas Relar is still in the very early stages of development.",

    "Can I transfer my Google Play Music library?",
    "There is currently no way to quickly transfer your library but this is something I want to implement before the release.",
