Welcome to the Relar repository ðŸŽµ

## About

Relar is a cloud music hosting and streaming service for your personal audio file collection. I started it in May 2020 when I became aware that Google Play Music was being removed later that year. Initially, I hoped to offer both a free and premium service but am starting a new job soon and won't have the necessary time to dedicate to this project. Instead, Relar is now an open source project :)

See it running at [https://relar.app](https://relar.app)

## Contributing

See [our Wiki](https://github.com/jsmith/relar/wiki) to learn about contributing to the project!

## Support

I plan to keep Relar hosted for free (with upload restrictions), implementing features and fixing bugs. Any support would be greatly appreciated â™¥
