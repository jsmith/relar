Welcome to the Relar repository ðŸŽµ

## About

Relar is a cloud music hosting and streaming service for your personal audio file collection. I started it in May 2020 when I became aware that Google Play Music was being removed later that year. Initially, I hoped to offer both a free and premium service but am starting a new job soon and won't have the necessary time to dedicate to this project. Instead, Relar is now an open source project :)

See it running at [https://relar.app](https://relar.app)

## Tech

Relar is built using [React](https://reactjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev). For the mobile apps, we use the exact same tech in addition to [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) for deployment to iOS and Android. We also use a ton of other amazing JavaScript packages such as [`neverthrow`](https://github.com/supermacro/neverthrow), [`framer-motion`](https://www.framer.com/motion), [`esbuild`](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild), [`workbox`](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) and [`react-window`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window).

## Contributing

See [our Wiki](https://github.com/jsmith/relar/wiki) to learn about contributing to the project!

## Support

I plan to keep Relar hosted for free (with upload restrictions), implementing features and fixing bugs. Any support would be greatly appreciated â™¥
